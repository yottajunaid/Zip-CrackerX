# Zip File Brute Force Tool üíÄüíÄüíÄ

This is a Python program designed to perform brute force attacks on password-protected zip files. It comes with both a Command Line Interface (CLI) version and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) version to cater to different user preferences.

## Features

- **CLI Version**: Allows users to execute the brute force attack from the command line interface, providing detailed feedback and results.
- **GUI Version**: Provides a user-friendly graphical interface for performing brute force attacks, making it easy for users to interact with the program.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Both versions of the program provide real-time feedback during the brute force attack, allowing users to monitor the progress and status of the attack.
- **Flexible**: Users can specify the zip file to be cracked and the wordlist to be used for the brute force attack, making the program flexible and adaptable to different scenarios.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The following Python libraries:
  - tkinter: For the GUI version.
  - subprocess: For running the brute force attack as a subprocess.
  - filedialog: For selecting the zip file and wordlist in the GUI version.
  - messagebox: For displaying warnings and messages in the GUI version.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yottajunaid/Zip-CrackerX.git
ls
cd Zip-CrackerX
python main.py
```
For GUI version
```bash
python gui_version.py
```

## Usage

### CLI Version

To run the CLI version of the program, navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file and execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to provide the path to the zip file and the wordlist, and the program will start the brute force attack.

### GUI Version

To run the GUI version of the program, navigate to the directory containing the `gui_version.py` file and execute the following command:
```bash
python gui_version.py
```

The GUI window will open, allowing you to select the zip file and wordlist and start the brute force attack with the click of a button.
